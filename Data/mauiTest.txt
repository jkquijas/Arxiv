In the model that has become known as "Perfectly Secure Message
Transmission"(PSMT), a sender Alice is connected to a receiver Bob through n
parallel two-way channels. A computationally unbounded adversary Eve controls t
of these channels, meaning she can acquire and alter any data that is
transmitted over these channels. The sender Alice wishes to communicate a
secret message to Bob privately and reliably, i.e. in such a way that Eve will
not get any information about the message while Bob will be able to recover it
completely.
  In this paper, we focus on protocols that work in two transmission rounds for
n= 2t+1. We break from previous work by following a conceptually simpler
blueprint for achieving a PSMT protocol. We reduce the previously best-known
communication complexity, i.e. the number of transmitted bits necessary to
communicate a 1-bit secret, from O(n^3 log n) to O(n^2 log n). Our protocol
also answers a question raised by Kurosawa and Suzuki and hitherto left open:
their protocol reaches optimal transmission rate for a secret of size O(n^2 log
n) bits, and the authors raised the problem of lowering this threshold. The
present solution does this for a secret of O(n log n) bits. Additionally, we
show how our protocol can be adapted to a Network Coding context.
