<summary>  Using Weitzenbock Induced Matter Theory (WIMT), we study Schwarzschild
wormholes performing different foliations on an extended (non-vaccuum) 5D
manifold. We explore the geodesic equations for observers which are in the
interior of a traversable wormhole and how these observers can detect
gravito-magnetic monopoles which are dual to gravito-electric sources observed
in the outer zone of some Schwarzschild Black-Hole (BH). The densities of these
monopoles are calculated and quantized in the Dirac sense. This kind of duality
on the extended Einstein-Maxwell equations, relates electric and magnetic
charges on causally disconnected space regions.

different interplanetary magnetic field orientations on the day side of the
planet. We use a single fluid MHD model in spherical coordinates to simulate
the interaction of the solar wind with the Hermean magnetosphere for six solar
wind realistic configurations with different magnetic field orientations:
Mercury-Sun, Sun-Mercury, aligned with the magnetic axis of Mercury (Northward
and Southward) and with the orbital plane perpendicular to the previous cases.
In the Mercury-Sun (Sun-Mercury) simulation the Hermean magnetic field is
weakened in the South-East (North-East) of the magnetosphere leading to an
enhancement of the flows on the South (North) hemisphere. For a Northward
(Southward) orientation there is an enhancement (weakening) of the Hermean
magnetic field in the nose of the bow shock so the fluxes are reduced and
drifted to the poles (enhanced and drifted to the equator). If the solar wind
magnetic field is in the orbital plane the magnetosphere is tilted to the West
(East) and weakened at the nose of the shock, so the flows are enhanced and
drifted to the East (West) in the Northern hemisphere and to the West (East) in
the Southern hemisphere.
</summary><summary>  The sudden short duration decrease in cosmic ray flux is known as Forbush
decrease which is mainly caused by interplanetary disturbances. Generally
accepted view is that the first step of Forbush decrease is due to shock sheath
and second step is due to Magnetic Cloud (MC) of Interplanetary Coronal Mass
Ejection (ICME). However, there are few questions which needs detail
investigation. (i) Does the complete (or part of) ICME shock or MC contribute
in cosmic ray decrease? (ii) Is there any internal structure associated with
the ICMEs shock/MC which precisely contribute in decrease? To address these
questions we have studied a total of 18 large ($&gt;=8 \%$) Forbush decrease
events and associated ICMEs. Majority of events shows multi-steps Forbush
decrease profile. This leads into re-classification of Forbush decrease events
depending upon the number of steps observed in their respective profile. The
present study clearly indicates that not only broad regions (shock-sheath and
MC) contribute to Forbush decrease but also localized structures within
shock-sheath and MC have very much significant importance in Forbush decrease
profile.
</summary><summary>  We study 50 cosmic ray Forbush decreases (FDs) from the Oulu neutron monitor
data during 1997-2005 that were associated with Earth-directed interplanetary
coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Such events are generally thought to arise due
to the shielding of cosmic rays by a propagating diffusive barrier. The main
processes at work are the diffusion of cosmic rays across the large-scale
magnetic fields carried by the ICME and their advection by the solar wind. In
an attempt to better understand the relative importance of these effects, we
analyse the relationship between the FD profiles and those of the
interplanetary magnetic field (B) and the solar wind speed (Vsw). Over the
entire duration of a given FD, we find that the FD profile is generally well
(anti)correlated with the B and Vsw profiles. This trend holds separately for
the FD main and recovery phases too. For the recovery phases, however, the FD
profile is highly anti-correlated with the Vsw profile, but not with the B
profile. While the total duration of the FD profile is similar to that of the
Vsw profile, it is significantly longer than that of the B profile.
</summary><summary>  The aim of this study is to simulate the interaction of the solar wind with
the Hermean magnetosphere when the interplanetary magnetic field is weak,
performing a parametric study for all the range of hydrodynamic values of the
solar wind predicted on Mercury for the ENLIL + GONG WSA + Cone SWRC model:
density from $12$ to $180$ cm$^{-3}$, velocity from $200$ to $500$ km/s and
temperatures from $2 \cdot 10^4$ to $18 \cdot 10^4$ K, and compare the results
with a real MESSENGER orbit as reference case. We use the code PLUTO in
spherical coordinates and an asymmetric multipolar expansion for the Hermean
magnetic field. The study shows for all simulations a stand off distance larger
than the Mercury radius and the presence of close magnetic field lines on the
day side of the planet, so the dynamic pressure of the solar wind is not high
enough to push the magnetopause on the planet surface if the interplanetary
magnetic field is weak. The simulations with large dynamic pressure lead to a
large compression of the Hermean magnetic field modifying its topology in the
inner magnetosphere as well as the plasma flows from the magnetosheath towards
the planet surface.
