The Gibbs sampler is one of the most popular algorithms for inference in statistical models.
In this paper, we introduce a herding variant of this algorithm, called herded Gibbs, that
is entirely deterministic. We prove that herded Gibbs has an O(1/T) convergence rate for
models with independent variables and for fully connected probabilistic graphical models.
Herded Gibbs is shown to outperform Gibbs in the tasks of image denoising with MRFs
and named entity recognition with CRFs. However, the convergence for herded Gibbs for
sparsely connected probabilistic graphical models is still an open problem.
